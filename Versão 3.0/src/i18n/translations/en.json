Living with pets brings countless benefits to people, such as: emotional bonding, more joy at home and unity in the family. But the greatest benefit that adopting animals can bring us is the fight against abandonment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in Brazil alone, about 30 million animals are abandoned, with approximately 20 million dogs and 10 million cats. So, the Planeta Pets Project is here to fight pet abandonment and help you find a friend for life.",
